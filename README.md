# odin-recipes

This project was about creating a basic recipe site using only HTML.

Many skills were required to complete the project. These include
- knowing the basic HTML elements and how to apply them
- knowledge of git, git commit and git push (That one took a few tries)
- commit, commit, commit, commit
- troubleshooting and looking for the solution on forums, in articles and on youtube even sometimes. 
- Patience and the habit to double and triple check your own work for mistakes.
