    <h2>Description</h2>

     <p>Mauritian chicken biryani is a fan favourite that requires a lot of skills and time to prepare
     and as a result, is prepared for special occasions or by people who specialise in the art of making it. 
     Indeed, a good biryani requires the use of all of the senses and producing a good one is a work of art. 
     The aroma is distinctive and permeates the house as the biryani is cooking.</p>

     <p>The Mauritian version contains potatoes and has very distinct flavours. 
     It is milder than an Indian or Middle Eastern biryani and is usually served 
     with a side of cucumber salad or pickles.</p>
